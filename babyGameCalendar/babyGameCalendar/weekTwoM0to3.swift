Wiggling the toys can also help baby look at the new toys. When baby is able to sit up, take down the mobile due to safety risks. Helps baby develop vision by providing interesting objects and colors to look at."

Don't forget to always place baby on back to sleep. Helps baby build strength by turning different directions to see you."
